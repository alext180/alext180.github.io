this is some markdown below the title. as you can see, index.md is the default landing page. we can list blog posts here, or we could move them somewhere else.
we probably want to organize the blog posts in some way or have different "series" of posts, e.g. "critiques" "theory" "praxis" etc. instead of just listing them chronologically. In that case, maybe we put an index of links here on this page to the different "series"

## Check out our blog series by category:
- [Critiques](https://alext180.github.io/test/)
- [Theory](https://alext180.github.io/test/)
- [Praxis](https://alext180.github.io/test/)

## Alternatively, check out our blog posts in chronological order:
