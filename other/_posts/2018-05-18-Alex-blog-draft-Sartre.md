### Sartre's notion of the project <a name="first"></a>

In *Questions de méthode*, Jean-Paul Sartre reflects on his assigned readings on Marx, Hegel, Aristotle, etc. at the University of Paris during the 1920s,

> I found everything perfectly clear, and I really understood absolutely nothing. To understand is to change, to go beyond oneself. This reading did not change me. By contrast, what did begin to change me was the *reality* of Marxism, the heavy presence on my horizon of the masses of workers, an enormous, sombre body which *lived* Marxism, which practiced it, and which at a distance exercised an irresistible attraction on petit bourgeois intellectuals.

The first time I read this passage it struck me as a particularly powerful expression of the conception of philosophy as a fundamentally practical activity (reminiscent of both Marx and Lenin), but what I found even more striking was Sartre's appeal to the process of "going beyond oneself". This kind of subjectivity in motion turns out to be a crucial element of Sartre's existential psychology, and later in *Questions de méthode* he elaborates on the idea, formalizing it in the notion of *the project.* 

Asserting the need for a philosophy of revolutionary action, Marx famously wrote that, "Philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways. The point, however, is to change it." On the other hand, Lenin says, "Without revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement" and thus we discover a dialectical relationship between *theory* and *praxis*: each one turns back upon the other, clarifying it in an endless process of becoming. 

Of course, from the perspective of historical materialism, only a theory which takes into account the real material conditions and social relations of the historical moment could ever hope to inform a useful revolutionary praxis; however, it is man who creates his material conditions and arranges the social relations he shares with other men on the basis of prior conditions - we recall the question from the *Theses on Feuerbach* about "who educates the educator?"

All of a sudden, a philosophy of individual existence enters the stage in the theater of collective action, and here Sartre's notion of *the project* plays a lead role. Simply put, the individual's project is their chosen way of being, expressed through their praxis; that is, through their real activity (collective or otherwise) in understanding and organizing their material conditions and social relations in the light of some end. So technically speaking there is no "the project" per se, rather there are *projects*, but Sartre uses the phrase in its full generality to refer to the way individuals reflect upon their conditions to clarify their philosophy in the first instance and then transform those very conditions in the second. 

<!--The first time I read this passage it struck me as a particularly powerful expression of the idea of philosophy as a fundamentally practical activity, a sentiment shared by Marx who famously writes that "the point" of philosophy is to change the world, and also by Lenin who states that "without revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary practice". Thus we find Sartre firmly aligned with Marxism-Leninism in his perspective of philosophy in general. Perhaps even more striking was--> 

> Man defines himself by his project. This material being perpetually goes beyond the condition which is made for him; he reveals and determines his situation by transcending it in order to objectify himself - by work, action, or gesture.

In other words *the project* is a transcendence because its movement of subjectivity entails the going beyond of present conditions, towards a future which at once negates and incorporates them. Man surpasses his situation and reconstitutes himself in relation to his ends, his needs, the sought-after reality, and so on. Through his project the individual "reveals and determines his situation," he locates himself in the totality of history and situates himself in relation to the class struggle, the struggles of race, gender, etc. In fact, Sartre contends that a key aspect distinguishing man from other animals is his ability to be *historical*; that is, Sartre writes, "he can continually define himself by his own *praxis* by means of changes suffered or provoked and their internalization, and then by the very surpassing of the internalized relations." Thus the project is at once an externalization of interiority and at the same time an internalization of exteriority. 

If it is true that man locates himself in the totality of history through action, work and organizing the world in accordance with his vision and creativity, then the project must be the living resultant of this pursuit - man projects himself into the world as a unified subject-object, living and creating the totality through his own particularities. It's interesting that Sartre uses the noun *the project*, which means something like "an objective endeavor" in English, and also at several points connects it to the verb *to project* via the word *projection*, because the latter suggests something like *sending beyond* or *going beyond*, and *the project* really does kind of concretize that rather abstract idea. 

<!--locates himself in history?-->

<!--totality?-->

<!--The movement of his subjectivity manifests an objective originating in his reaction to scarcity and in the satisfaction of needs,-->

<!--project is chosen way of being, expressed in praxis-->

<!--transcends his situation: at once negating and incorporating them, reconstituting himself in relation to sought after reality - but if transcendence involves negation then what can we say about NON-radical projects? how do these involve negation if they merely perpetuate or affirm the status quo?-->

<!--?? "Radical" project?-->

<!--Indeed, through his work and action man "objectifies himself," that is, becomes a concrete historical object (cf Marx?)-->

<!--Surpassing material/historical conditions, organizing the world in accordance with his creative vision, this is all reminiscent of Marcuse: Discovering a reality principle of man's own, Marcuse recalls *the projects* of Narcissus and Orpheus (cf Marcuse) - indicates the intrinsically radical potentialities of reflection, etc.-->

<!--which is at the same immersed in the movement of subjectivity, manifests an objective originating in the satisfaction of needs.-->

<!--The project, as hypostatized abstraction, indicates the process whereby an individual locates himself in history and manifests himself in a process of going beyond.-->

<!--Naturally, we find in the Sartrean project elements of both Marxist and existentialist philosophy.-->

### The blog as a radical tool <a name="second"></a>

There's an endless depth available for discussion here, and this note isn't supposed to be an exhaustive or comprehensive analysis of the notion of the project within the context of Sartre's existential psychology and Marxist philosophy. Instead, what I want to discuss is how the ideas underlying the Sartrean project can serve as the motivating schemata for conceiving of a blog as an effective instrument in developing a radical Sartrean project -- a project of revolt -- if this is indeed what one wants to make of their project. Since a blog mostly involves writing about stuff, this discussion will necessarily entail an elaboration of the connections between writing, reflection, and the project. So we ask Sartre: how does the individual as reader and writer factor into the project?

> The writer neither foresees nor conjectures; he *projects* ... the writer meets everywhere only *his* knowledge, *his* will, *his* plans, in short, himself ... Thus, by speaking, I reveal the situation by my very intention of changing it; I reveal it to myself and to others in order to change it. I strike at its very heart, I transpierce it, and I display it in full view; at present I dispose of it; with every word I utter, I involve myself a little more in the world, and by the same token I emerge from it a little more, since I go beyond it toward the future.

In this passage Sartre vehemently reaffirms writing as an effective instrument for facilitating a radical praxis (somewhat unsurprisingly, considering his bias as a lifelong professional writer). Not only can writing be a valid part of the project he says, but by its very nature the process of writing necessarily becomes a part of the writer's project: in the very act of writing the writer *projects*, he reveals his situation in order to change it. In the activity of writing we also rediscover those same key elements of the project which Sartre identified in *Questions de méthode*: the process involves transcendence, going beyond the present situation and towards the future. You write in order to set up relations between things in the world, to project an abstraction of your own goals, desires, and objectives onto your creation, or ... <span style="color:red">???</span> 

When Steinbeck writes *The Grapes of Wrath* he strikes at the "individualist" heart of American conservatism in order to display in full view its intellectual impoverishment, through the plight of the Joad family he transpierces the contradictions inherent in capitalist economic organization. When Ayn Rand writes *Atlas Shrugged* she reflects upon the expropriation of her bourgeois family's private property during the Russian revolution, and manufactures a mythologized laissez-faire capitalism in order to vindicate the bourgeois antithesis of her trauma. Evidently some projects are more radical than others.

It's important to note here that Sartre really is talking about writing in general and not just serious, philosophical or political writing (although in *What is Literature?* he does -- arguably unjustifiably -- express severe disdain for excessively poetic writing). In fact I think he views any kind of writing, fiction or non-fiction, as a valid way of coming to terms with and reflecting upon one's situation. Moreover, even when the writer is totally unaware of the political and philosophical dimensions of their work or intentionally avoids such themes, I think Sartre would identify in that writing a kind of unconscious expression of one's subjective orientation to their materiality and historicity. 

OK, but why is a public website an appropriate method of projection? Well, Sartre argues that sharing your creative work with other people in some way is a crucial aspect of the creative process.

> It is not true that one writes for himself. That would be the worst blow. In projecting his emotions on paper, one barely manages to give them a languishing extension. The creative act is only an incomplete abstract moment in the production of a work. If the author existed alone he would be able to write as much as he liked; the work as *object* would never see the light of day and he would either have to put down his pen or despair. But the operation of writing implies that of reading as its dialectical correlative and these two connected acts necessitate two distinct agents. It is the conjoint effort of author and reader which brings upon the scene that concrete and imaginary object which is the work of the mind. There is no art except for, and by others.

So, although keeping a secret diary under your bed could stimulate reflection and help you grapple with and understand your situation, Sartre says that this kind of writing is only an "incomplete abstract moment" in the process of writing, the written work lacks a social character as it has not yet been brought into the world as a concrete historical object; reading is the "dialectical correlative" of writing, since the reader facilitates the movement from subjective to objective and the externalization of the internal, they are an essential component of writing when it comes to engaging in praxis as a transcendence. Not that we expect anyone to read this blog, in the same way that any writer is uncertain if anyone will read their work, but I guess it's the possibility that matters.

In the preceding paragraphs we've established that Sartre thinks writing is a viable tool for developing the individual project (presumably he would be cool with putting it on a website too), and we're inclined to believe him because, well... he's the one that came up with the whole "the project" thing! Unfortunately, he doesn't go into much detail; for example, a project could be revolutionary or it could simply perpetuate the status quo, and Sartre doesn't elaborate on how the process of writing and reflection can facilitate a truly radical project, one which externalizes internal desires as revolutionary opportunities and surpasses the present reality towards a future of liberation from subjugation. 

<!-- he doesn't elaborate on how the reflective aspect of writing can facilitate the process of transcendence which is a crucial aspect of the project, and moreover he does not describe ???.--> 

We will have to fill in the gaps ourselves. Recall that the project is expressed through praxis, which involves both the internalization and surpassing of one's material, social, and historical situation (towards a future which could either perpetuate or subvert domination); thus, in order to understands the extent to which the blog can function as a tool for developing a genuinely radical project, we must investigate the following two problems:

1. How can writing and discussion facilitate the process of going beyond oneself, and surpassing our present situation towards a future of liberation? Is it not sufficient to simply read a good article or book written by a Marxist, socialist, etc. and internalize the words on the pages?
2. How can reflection facilitate the process of going beyond oneself, and surpassing our present situation towards a future of liberation?

### Freire's problem-posing pedagogy as a model for the dialogic blog <a name="third"></a>

We answer the first question by appealing to an analogy between the reader-writer and student-teacher dichotomies vis-à-vis Freire's conception of a radical pedagogy. Freire characterizes the form of institutionalized education prevailing in modern capitalist society as a "banking model of education" in which "a narrating Subject (the teacher)" deposits information into the "patient, listening objects (the students)" by means of a pedagogical model which speaks of reality as if it were "motionless, static, compartmentalized, and predictable." There is no communication; students merely receive, memorize, and repeat the instructions bestowed upon them by the teacher. This educational system, Freire says, perpetuates the oppression of marginalized peoples, the destruction of Knowledge and creativity, and the alienation of both the students and the teachers. Moreover, Freire argues that a radical pedagogy of liberation, one involving a dissolution of the contradictions inherent in the student-teacher relationship of the banking model, must be a kind of "problem-posing education". In *The Pedagogy of the Oppressed* Freire writes,

> Indeed, problem-posing education, which breaks with the vertical patterns characteristic of banking education, can fulfill its function as the practice of freedom only if it can overcome the [teacher-student] contradiction. Through dialogue, the teacher-of-the-students and the students-of-the-teacher cease to exist and a new term emerges: teacher-student with students-teachers. The teacher is no longer merely the-one-who-teaches, but one who is himself taught in dialogue with the students, who in turn while being taught also teach.

The reader-writer relationship is not immediately analogous to the student-teacher relationship because it is necessarily one-sided: there is usually no dialogue between the reader and the writer, whereas Freire argues the student-teacher relation ought to be dialogic. However, in the case of the blog writer reflecting upon his reading during the writing process, the reader and the writer become one -- the reader is in the first instance the student, and then becomes the teacher in the second instance when writing about the text. 

Thus, the silent internalization of the pages of a book entails some of the contradictions of the depositor-depository pedagogy, whereas the dual process of reading and writing facilitated by the blog can be interpreted in terms of the problem-posing pedagogy: this process situates the writer as not merely "the-one-who-teaches" through their writing, but one who is himself taught in dialogue with the past self as reader-student. Of course, this dialogic relationship is even stronger when other people are involved in the project, collaborating and discussing throughout the reading-writing process as a group of teacher-students and student-teachers. "Here, no one teaches another, nor is anyone self-taught. People teach each other, mediated by the world, by the cognizable objects which in banking education are "owned" by the teacher." Freire is explicit in his affirmation of this kind of mutual dialogue as an important mechanism for liberation.

> [Dialogue] is an act of creation; it must not serve as a crafty instrument for the domination of one person by another. The domination implicit in dialogue is that of the world by the dialogues; it is conquest of the world for the liberation of humankind.

Freire delineates several crucial aspects of this dialogue which suggest to us the appropriate tone for the blog as an instrument for a radical project; namely, Freire emphasizes that there can be no dialogue without humility, hope, faith in humankind, and critical thinking. We must exercise humility: how can we engage in a program of mutual learning and understanding if any one of us considers ourselves the sole owners of truth and knowledge? How can I dialogue if I regard myself as superior or dismiss the contributions of others? "At the point of encounter there are neither utter ignoramuses nor perfect sages," Freire writes, "there are only people who are attempting, together, to learn more than they now know." Moreover, he says there can be no dialogue without hope:

> Hopelessness is a form of silence, of denying the world and fleeing from it. The dehumanization resulting from an unjust order is not a cause for despair but for hope, leading to the incessant pursuit of the humanity denied by injustice.

Reflecting on these ideas, we derive the foundations for a project of revolt. In general, we will always aim to convey a sense of humility, tones of hope and faith in humanity, and always remain critical in our analysis -- we are in agreement with Marx when he says that our affair involves a "ruthless criticism of all that exists" -- in particular this means skepticism of every established doctrine, capitalist, socialist, or otherwise.

### Marcuse's contemplative culture-hero as a symbol of radical reflection <a name="fourth"></a>

We answer the second question by appealing to Marcuse's radical interpretation of the Greek myths of the contemplative heroes Orpheus and Narcissus in *Eros and Civilization*. Searching Greek mythology for cultural heroes who symbolize a very different reality from the prevailing capitalist reality of ceaseless toil, productivity and progress through repression, Marcuse recalls the stories of Orpheus and Narcissus: Orpheus, the prodigal musician and poet of Thrace whose song "pacifies the animal world, reconciles the lion with the lamb and the lion with man," and Narcissus, who, in the mirror of the water, tries to grasp his own beauty, who bends over and the river of time and implores "Alas, when will Time cease its flight and allow this flow to rest?" 

Contrary to the orthodox academic interpretation of these heroes as "miraculous, incredible, superhuman" with stories that are at best "poetic, something for the soul and the heart," Marcuse says instead that the images of Orpheus and Narcissus "recall the experience of a world that is not to be mastered and controlled but to be liberated -- a freedom that will release the powers of Eros now bound in the repressed and petrified forms of man and nature." The Orphic experience is one which reconciles man and nature, recognizes the beauty in nature for itself and sees nature as an end-in-itself. Rejecting the predominant reality principle which demands toil and perpetuates repression, "Orpheus is the archetype of the poet as liberator and creator: he establishes a higher order in the world -- an order without repression. In his person, art, freedom, and culture are eternally combined." In a similar vein, the Narcissistic experience is one which reconciles subject with object -- the subject outside of the reflection and the object of beauty in the reflection. He is enraptured not with the beauty of the man he sees reflected in the river, but with the unity of the man with nature in the image of man superimposed upon nature. 

Through their contemplation of art and nature Orpheus and Narcissus both offer "another existential relation to reality" and hint at "a non-repressive mode of sublimation which results from an extension rather than from a constraining deflection of the libido." Orpheus and Narcissus reject the established system of domination, they "protest against the repressive order of procreative sexuality," and ultimately "reveal a new reality, with an order of its own, governed by different principles." Thus, they master cruelty and death through liberation, "[Orpheus'] language is *song* and his work is *play*. Narcissus' life is that of *beauty* and his existence is *contemplation*."

The reconciliation between subject and object represented by the contemplative, aesthetic *projects* of Orpheus and Narcissus indicates the intrinsically radical potentialities of the comprehension facilitated by reflection within writing since, as Marcuse suggests elsewhere in *Eros and Civilization*,

> ... the logic of domination does not triumph unchallenged. The philosophy which epitomizes the antagonistic relation between subject and object also retains the image of their reconciliation. The restless labor of the transcending subject terminates in the ultimate unity of subject and object: the idea of "being-in-and-for-itself," existing in its own fulfillment.

Of course, writing and reflection cannot constitute the full extent of a truly radical project because such a project necessarily entails the transformative aspects of radical praxis: revolutionary action, political activism, involvement in the community, etc. All we want to say is that the kind of activity (learning, exploring, reflecting, etc.) which is facilitated (and not exclusively) by the blog plays an essential role in the development of such a project, and in our case, the medium of the blog specifically happens to be a convenient and effective means for accomplishing this task for a group of people enjoying the privileges of living in the wealthy geographic center of the global capitalist imperialist order. As a result, we (the blog authors) intend this blog to facilitate that process of education and exploration, to stimulate reflection and discussion amongst ourselves and our friends, and to simply track our intellectual development as we carry on our never-ending movement of subjectivity.

<!--There's an endless depth available for discussion here, and this note isn't supposed to be an exhaustive or comprehensive analysis of the notion of the project. Instead, what I want to discuss is the connection between writing, reflection, and the project, the extent to which writing about stuff can fulfill the Sartrean project (serve as a tool for the project...) for an individual or for a group, and how these ideas can serve as the ideological foundations for conceiving of the blog as a tool to develop a radical Sartrean project, a project of revolt.-->

<!--Of course, writing a blog cannot be the full extent of project, action, praxis, etc. We also need a practical, material element in activism etc. So we intend this blog to serve merely as a reflection of intellectual development and so on, to catalogue some thoughts and ideas, to stimulate reflection and discussion amongst ourselves and our friends, see Vyom's explanation.--> 

<!--We've already touched on a significant aspect of internal reflection in relation to the project - the project is __ to praxis which is __ to internalization and surpassing material, social, historical conditions. But (insert some set of important questions I want to address in the following paragraphs)-->

<!--Next refer to Freire problem-posing education, then talk about teacher-student as analogy with writer-reader, and talk about Sartre's implementation of "the project" in "what is literature?"-->
