### Preface <a name="first"></a>
For many of us, women have played the predominant social role of carrying out childcare, cooking, cleaning, and other forms of housework.

### Theorizing Wages for Housework <a name="third"></a>

I’ll try to summarize the main arguments here for context (although I cannot do it justice in this short space):
- Wages for Housework should be viewed as a revolutionary political perspective instead of a “thing, a lump of money” whose struggle would require a revolutionizing of family and social relations
- Housework is a qualitatively distinct kind of labor relation from wage labor--wage labor is socialized (the worker is separate from the work), the wage recognizes that you are a worker, whereas housework has been transformed into a natural attribute of women, “an internal need.” In this way, it functions as a powerful weapon of capitalist ideology which reinforces capitalism:
	- Unwaged housework enables the ruling class to get “a hell of a lot of work almost for free”
	- It disciplines the male worker "by making his woman dependent on his work and his wage"--gives him a personal servant who services him physically, emotionally and sexually 
- Of course, housework is not a natural attribute of housewives--it takes at least twenty years of training, typically done by unwaged mothers. Many women recognize that marriage is for money and security. Any struggle against this social role is vehemently chastised, turned into a personal failure and abnormality.
- Demanding WfH refuses this ideological naturalization of women’s role. In struggling for wages, they struggle "unambiguously and directly against [houseworkers'] social role." This struggle for wages is more similar to the “struggles of the slave for a wage against that slavery” than the waged laborer’s struggle for higher wages.
- WfH is not a struggle to enter capitalist relations, since women have never been out of them--it is a struggle to break capital’s plan for women, to break that planned division of labor and social power within the working class. The wage can demystify and de-naturalize the social role of women, giving them the ability to begin refusing to do this work.
- Socialization and support for care services should absolutely be struggled for, but these demands will "always be frustrated if we do not first establish that our work is work." It also risks extending the capitalist state’s control over children and families if it is not controlled by people themselves.
- Getting a second job does not change the social role of women in capitalism--it not only increases their exploitation (they have to work outside + inside the home), it also reproduces their role in different forms. Women often do jobs that are extensions of housework--nurses, maids, teachers, secretaries. 
- WfH is beneficial to the whole working class, as capital has kept the working class divided, "disciplined them [male wage laborers] through us [housewives] and us through them--each other, against each other." Breaking this division is opening up collective liberation.
- Housewives indeed occupy one of the most socially powerless and isolated positions--the problem is to "bring this struggle out of the kitchen and bedroom and into the streets."
