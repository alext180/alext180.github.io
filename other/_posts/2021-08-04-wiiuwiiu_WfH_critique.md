### Preface <a name="first"></a>
For many of us, women have played the predominant social role of carrying out childcare, cooking, cleaning, and other forms of housework.


### A selective history of patriarchy and capitalism <a name="second"></a>


### Theorizing Wages for Housework <a name="third"></a>

I’ll try to summarize the main arguments here for context (although I cannot do it justice in this short space):
- Wages for Housework should be viewed as a revolutionary political perspective instead of a “thing, a lump of money” whose struggle would require a revolutionizing of family and social relations
- Housework is a qualitatively distinct kind of labor relation from wage labor--wage labor is socialized (the worker is separate from the work), the wage recognizes that you are a worker, whereas housework has been transformed into a natural attribute of women, “an internal need.” In this way, it functions as a powerful weapon of capitalist ideology which reinforces capitalism:
	- Unwaged housework enables the ruling class to get “a hell of a lot of work almost for free”
	- It disciplines the male worker "by making his woman dependent on his work and his wage"--gives him a personal servant who services him physically, emotionally and sexually 
- Of course, housework is not a natural attribute of housewives--it takes at least twenty years of training, typically done by unwaged mothers. Many women recognize that marriage is for money and security. Any struggle against this social role is vehemently chastised, turned into a personal failure and abnormality.
- Demanding WfH refuses this ideological naturalization of women’s role. In struggling for wages, they struggle "unambiguously and directly against [houseworkers'] social role." This struggle for wages is more similar to the “struggles of the slave for a wage against that slavery” than the waged laborer’s struggle for higher wages.
- WfH is not a struggle to enter capitalist relations, since women have never been out of them--it is a struggle to break capital’s plan for women, to break that planned division of labor and social power within the working class. The wage can demystify and de-naturalize the social role of women, giving them the ability to begin refusing to do this work.
- Socialization and support for care services should absolutely be struggled for, but these demands will "always be frustrated if we do not first establish that our work is work." It also risks extending the capitalist state’s control over children and families if it is not controlled by people themselves.
- Getting a second job does not change the social role of women in capitalism--it not only increases their exploitation (they have to work outside + inside the home), it also reproduces their role in different forms. Women often do jobs that are extensions of housework--nurses, maids, teachers, secretaries. 
- WfH is beneficial to the whole working class, as capital has kept the working class divided, "disciplined them [male wage laborers] through us [housewives] and us through them--each other, against each other." Breaking this division is opening up collective liberation.
- Housewives indeed occupy one of the most socially powerless and isolated positions--the problem is to "bring this struggle out of the kitchen and bedroom and into the streets."


### IMT's critique of WfH <a name="fourth"></a>

To recap, these are the main points made by David in the article:

* Housework is not unpaid--its cost is included in the husband's wage, as explained by Marx's LTV
* Procreation and parenting are outside the circuit of the capitalist economy. Products of care work have only use values, no exchange values, since they are not exchanged on a market
* Wages for Housework would perpetuate the role of the housewife, the woman as the beast of burden, cut off from the social world, boxed into the house
* Women's liberation can only come through the socialisation of housework through care institutions and professional care workers etc., freeing them up from the burden of housework
* Wages for Housework is utopian, unrealistic, illusory
* Wages for Housework is too accommodating to capitalism, capitalists would love to split the wage into 2 packets, Federici et al. advocate for this "realistic" and "pragmatic" tactic which just seeks crumbs

### The problems with IMT's critique <a name="fifth"></a>

My critiques include:

##### **1a. Internal inconsistency**

Points 5 and 6 in David’s article are internally contradictory. David especially pushes point 6, saying that capitalists would love to accommodate the WfH demand. This neglects the entire history of the WfH movement and fails to explain why capitalists and their state apparatus vehemently opposed this campaign.

##### **1b. David fails to identify clear areas of overlap** between the his analysis and that of WfH feminists. 

###### i. Both see the housewife’s material relation to production as closer to the historical form of domestic slavery than wage labor:

Consider Marx in Value, Price and Profit:

> Although one part only of the workman's daily labour is paid, while the other part is unpaid, and while that unpaid or surplus labour constitutes exactly the fund out of which surplus value or profit is formed, it seems as if the aggregate labour was paid labour. 
>
> This false appearance distinguishes wages labour from other historical forms of labour. On the basis of the wages system even the unpaid labour seems to be paid labour. With the slave, on the contrary, even that part of his labour which is paid appears to be unpaid. Of course, in order to work the slave must live, and one part of his working day goes to replace the value of his own maintenance. But since no bargain is struck between him and his master, and no acts of selling and buying are going on between the two parties, all his labour seems to be given away for nothing.

Thus Marx seems to agree with WfH feminists that slave labor *is* unpaid in the social sense since there is no work contract, no acts of selling and buying, it socially appears as unpaid, there is no social recognition of the fact that work is being done. WfH feminists accept that the cost of reproducing the housewife’s being and labor is included in the husband’s wage--this constitutes the problem, it chains the housewife to the husband’s wage and whims, it creates a different material relationship to economic production. Isn’t it a bit chauvinistic to assume that women and houseworkers do not know this visceral reality? 

Notably, Federici calls this condition “unwaged” in *Wages against Housework.* In later works WfH feminists do use the term “unpaid,” as do econometric organizations such as the International Labor Organization. This is perfectly consistent with Marxist theory, as long as it is understood that by “unpaid” is meant the kind of material relationship where no acts of selling and buying are going on, no bargain is struck, and all the laborer’s labor seems to be given away for nothing. You would have to call all historical forms of slave labor (such as unpaid prison labor where nevertheless the prisoners’ sustenance is paid for by the prison institution) “paid” if you accept David’s analysis.

This might be overkill, but consider this analogy: 

- Imagine that I picked up a homeless person from a government homeless shelter, told them I would pay them to do household chores like cleaning cooking etc., and then I didn't pay them by saying "oh sorry your payment is already included in the taxes I pay which fund the shelter services that sustain you and your class." That is clearly absurd and we would call this a case of unpaid labor. It is a similar situation with the unpaid care worker.

  

###### ii. Both want to free women from the burden of housework

Consider Federici in *Wages \*against\* Housework*:

![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/f0L1NPkkNxQl_zO4nuRQNA9_by-WHoEry218wOCi6MbP9dv-jngeeIHxqcePeHvk0HKpHDRdroml9vjCWi5p0GMrEqlpscngdx9W8LpiyuAa6j8LZihHb2k0gTiJdxmbOPxVNLpz)

David does not mention any of this, dishonestly declaring:

> “What is Federici proposing? Housework is bad, but work in a company is also bad. Moreover, we then have a “second shift” at home with child rearing, cleaning, etc. So, since we see no other alternative, it would be better to go back to the home that enslaves us, but we demand a wage in exchange.”

Of course, there are important questions raised here. Would a wage for care work tie women to the household? How would a wage enable women to refuse the social role imposed on them? What would a labor organization of care workers look like? What would their protest actions such as striking, rallying, etc look like? David raises some of these questions, but his intellectual dishonesty consists of not examining the theory and practice of the WfH movement that attempted to directly answer them. This also shows why it is important to look at the history and actual material struggles involved in the movement, something you assert is besides the point and not related to these important questions.

#### **1c. David omits several important questions** in his analysis

###### i. The question of surplus labor and value production

Consider Marx in *Das Kapital, Volume III*: 

> The specific economic form, in which unpaid surplus-labour is pumped out of direct producers, determines the relationship of rulers and ruled.

As mentioned before, Marx, David, and WfH feminists are all in agreement that the cost of reproducing the houseworker’s labor, i.e. the cost of their labor power, is included in the husband’s wage. However, the houseworker’s labor does not simply reproduce itself--houseworkers do not merely sustain themselves. The houseworker in fact engages in *surplus labor*--their work may include facilitating the reproduction of the husband’s labor power (cooking, cleaning, sexual and emotional work that allows the husband to continue his wage labor) as well as the care of children and elderly that may later enter the labor market. There is a clear, causal, material relationship here that plays a crucial role in reproducing capitalist society at large. What value is generated by this surplus labor, and who appropriates this surplus labor? Does the capitalist class benefit from this surplus labor? Instead of considering these questions, David blindly asserts the following point:

###### ii. That unpaid housework and care work are outside the circuit of capitalism

David completely ignores WfH feminists’ arguments that the house is actually a site of value production and appropriation, and thus a crucial site for struggle. Instead David’s assertion supports bourgeois ideology which says “where women are concerned, their labor is a personal service outside of capital.” This is cemented by David’s assertion of the housewife’s inherent political backwardness:

> 

In doing so, David repeats the same orthodox positions that were said 50 years ago against the WfH movement, and responded to by WfH feminists:

Not only does David assert that housework is already paid for, he asserts that under socialism it should receive the same remuneration as unem

By doing so, David accepts and supports the capitalist ideology that says 

###### iii. The value of unpaid care work

David fails to even mention how huge of a problem unpaid care work is, not even attempting to analyze the material conditions surrounding it. Consider the question of the value of unpaid care work:

* This [2014 OECD report](https://www.oecd.org/dev/development-gender/Unpaid_care_work.pdf) says “If included, unpaid care work would constitute **40% of Swiss GDP** (Schiess and SchönBühlmann, 2004) and would be equivalent to **63% of Indian GDP** (Budlender, 2008).”This [Office of National Statistics report](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/womenshouldertheresponsibilityofunpaidwork/2016-11-10) in UK says that “ONS figures for 2014 show that total unpaid work had a value of £1.01tn, equivalent to approximately **56% of Gross Domestic Product** (GDP).”

* This [2017 UN report](https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/CN.6/2017/3) mentions that “The total value of unpaid care and domestic work is estimated to be between **10 and 39 per cent of GDP**, and can surpass that of manufacturing, commerce, transportation and other key sectors.” 

* This [2017 PwC report](https://www.pwc.com.au/australia-in-transition/publications/understanding-the-unpaid-economy-mar17.pdf) shows that unpaid childcare is the largest industry in Australia, followed by all other unpaid work, and then followed by other sectors.

* This [2020 Oxfam report](https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/research-publications/time-care/) says “Oxfam has calculated that this work adds value to the economy of at least **$10.8 trillion**. This figure, while huge, is an underestimate, and the true figure is far higher.”

Think about how huge these figures are, and what a large sector of economic production is constituted by unpaid care work. What material analysis of this behemoth of value production does David provide? None at all--he does not even stop to consider the impact organization and resistance around this sphere of production would have on capitalism, much less examine the history of such struggles. 

###### iv. The relation between paid and unpaid care work

David advocates for the socialization of housework without looking at the history and material conditions of the domestic labor market. Consider this theoretical point made by WfH feminists in the 70’s:

![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6yMcCL37J6Wpb2Ibxdif1IYg2HmhF7BI1o7GwyEvaGz6aHT-xWnwyvRVWpBJIt7D39p2wCsSMfa_mcefn5npglhABB5WnYhhdKpkoICWsw50dO_bULxCiIm0n0DyXiz-MWjXsv2s)

Further consider this [2020 Economic Policy Institute report](https://www.epi.org/publication/domestic-workers-chartbook-a-comprehensive-look-at-the-demographics-wages-benefits-and-poverty-rates-of-the-professionals-who-care-for-our-family-members-and-clean-our-homes/#chart1) on paid domestic workers in the US:

![2020_epi_paid_domestic_workers](..\..\about\images\2020_epi_paid_domestic_workers.png)

It turns out paid domestic workers are “among the most exploited workers in the world,” (Oxfam, Time to Care report) with much less coverage by labor laws and minimum wage protections. WfH feminists provide a historical materialist explanation for this phenomenon: capitalism usually appropriates this surplus labor for free and under conditions of domestic slavery, thus its market extensions are super-exploited as well. Whether the WfH struggle would improve the position of this sector of the working class, David does not say. 

###### v. Whether WfH is a complementary demand to the socialization of housework

WfH feminists have a clear stance on the demand to socialize housework:

![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/L1tQ67snxEh1iRdjfNlRMGIlxySL27sw82PxOBXDW8XGbBNRnrlve6lZIMX-atq16X1szvMjjn6tya9h3r3uqlqJYKSNrcOX0eBN7JZNgDPBah6-hh1EISn2FrZqfzWC2IxROXRS)

In other words, capitalism will not automatically liberate houseworkers 

###### vi. The question of the origin of women’s exploitation--*why* are women enslaved to do most of society's housework and care work? 

Houseworkers often play a role as reserve-army of labor which exerts a downward pressure on men’s wages. Why wouldn’t WfH thus counter this position, where a struggle for wages for houseworkers would translate to a struggle for higher wages for all?
